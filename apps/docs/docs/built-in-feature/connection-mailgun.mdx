#### Step 2: Set Up Your Domain

1. **Go to the Domains Tab**: In your Mailgun dashboard, navigate to the **Domains** section.
2. **Add a New Domain**: Click “Add New Domain.” Here, you’ll need to enter a domain name. If you don’t have your own domain, you can use a subdomain like `mg.yourdomain.com`.

#### Step 4: Update Your Project’s Environment Variables

Now that you have your API key, it’s time to configure your project.

1. **Open Your Project’s `.env` File**: In the root of your project, open the `.env` file. If it doesn’t exist, create one.
2. **Add the Following Variables**:

```bash
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your-private-api-key-here
EMAIL_DOMAIN_NAME=your-domain.com
```

Replace `your-private-api-key-here` with the actual API key you copied and `your-domain.com` with your Mailgun domain.
