Niwi Starter allows you to personalize your blog with custom emojis. You can add emojis using a simple `:` keyword. The configuration is flexible, allowing you to modify or introduce your own emojis effortlessly.

If you’re interested in adding your own emojis, the process is straightforward, and we’ll guide you step-by-step below.

### How to Add Custom Emojis

<div className="relative rounded-[12px] overflow-hidden my-5">
  <img className="w-full" src="/blog/adding-emojis.gif" />
</div>

To add a new emoji, follow these steps:

1. First, place your new `gif` file inside the `/public/images/emojis` directory.

2. Next, update the configuration in the file located at: `emoji-config.ts`

This step finalizes the addition of your custom emoji. For example, if your new GIF file is named `hugging-face.gif`, the configuration would look like this:

```tsx title="/components/niwi-blog/niwi-text-editor/plugins/NiwiEmojiPlugin/config/emoji-config.ts"
export const customEmoji: Map<string, [string, string]> = new Map([
  // Custom Gifs
  [":3", ["emoji-img:meow_party.gif", " "]],
  [":B", ["emoji-img:bo_party.gif", " "]],
  [":F", ["emoji-img:fire_yellow.gif", " "]],
  [":R", ["emoji-img:raiva.gif", " "]],
  [":?", ["emoji-img:meow_question.gif", " "]],
  [":b", ["emoji-img:blog.gif", " "]],
  [":r", ["emoji-img:pink_ribbon.gif", " "]],
  [":C", ["emoji-img:cat_scratch.gif", " "]],

  // Adding a New Gif
  [":H", ["emoji-img:hugging-face.gif", " "]],
]);
```

Once this is done, your new emojis will be available for use in the blog editor, enhancing the customization options for your posts.

## Unsplash Image Picker Integration

If you want to include an Unsplash image picker in your blog, you'll need to set up the following environment variable:

Add the `NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` to your `.env` file with your Unsplash API access key.

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key-here
```

<div className="relative rounded-[12px] overflow-hidden my-5">
  <img className="w-full" src="/blog/unsplash.gif" />
</div>

### How to Get Your Unsplash API Access Key

Follow these steps to obtain your Unsplash API access key:

1. **Sign Up or Log In to Unsplash**  
   Visit [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com) and create an account if you don’t have one. If you already have an account, simply log in.

2. **Apply as a Developer**  
   Go to the [Unsplash Developer page](https://unsplash.com/developers) and click on **Get Started**. You’ll need to fill out a brief application explaining how you plan to use the API.

3. **Create a New Application**  
   Once your application is approved, navigate to the Developer Dashboard and click on **New Application**. Fill in the required details like the application name, description, and website URL.

4. **Get Your Access Key**  
   After creating your application, you’ll receive an **Access Key** and a **Secret Key**. You only need the Access Key for Niwi Starter. Copy it for the next step.

5. **Add the Access Key to Your `.env` File**  
   In your project’s root directory, create or update the `.env` file with the following line:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key-here
   ```

6. **Save and Restart Your Project**  
   Make sure to save your changes and restart your development server to apply the configuration.

This feature allows you to conveniently search for and insert high-quality images from Unsplash directly within the blog editor.
