# How to Get Twitter Auth Keys

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Go to the [Twitter Developer Dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard). If you don’t have a developer account, sign up first.
2. Once you’re in the developer dashboard, select **Projects & Apps** from the sidebar.
3. You’ll see a nested structure where the first level is the Project, and the inner level contains the Application.
4. Click on your application, which will take you to the app details page. Scroll down until you see **User authentication settings**.
5. Click **Setup**, which will guide you through the "User authentication settings".
6. Under **Type of App**, select **Web App, Automated App, or Bot**.
7. In the **App Info** section, set the **Callback URI / Redirect URL** to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/twitter`.
8. After adding your domain, you’ll receive your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

Add these credentials to your `.env` file:

```env
TWITTER_CLIENT_ID=your-twitter-client-id
TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET=your-twitter-client-secret
```
