# How to Get Google Auth Keys

## Step-by-Step Guide

- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Create a new project or select an existing one.
- In the left-hand menu, navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**.
- Click **Create Credentials** and choose **OAuth client ID**.
- Set up the consent screen by following the prompts. Choose **Web application** as the application type.
- Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add your application’s redirect URI. For local development, this is typically: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`.
- After completing the setup, you’ll receive your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

Next, add these credentials to your `.env` file:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```
