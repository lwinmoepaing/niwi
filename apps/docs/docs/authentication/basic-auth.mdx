# Authentication

## Niwi Basic Auth

Niwi provides basic email and password credential authentication. The Niwi Auth service is built on top of the `next-auth` service. You can view the authentication logic in the `/libs/auth/next-auth.ts` file.

### Default Credential Auth

Niwi uses the Credentials Provider as the default login system. The Credentials Provider allows you to handle signing in with custom credentials, giving you the flexibility to modify your authentication logic.

```tsx title="/libs/auth/next-auth.ts"
Credentials({
    async authorize(credentials) {
        // All authentication logic here
        // ...
        // ...
        return user;
    },
}),
```

## Other Social Auth

Niwi also supports social OAuth login with providers like `GoogleProvider`, `GithubProvider`, `FacebookProvider`, and `TwitterProvider`. You can check how this is implemented in the `/libs/auth/next-auth.ts` file.

```tsx title="/libs/auth/next-auth.ts"
providers: [
  GoogleProvider({
    clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID ?? "",
    clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET ?? "",
    authorization: {
      prompt: "consent",
      access_type: "offline",
      response_type: "code",
    },
  }),
  // ... Other OAuth Providers
];
```
