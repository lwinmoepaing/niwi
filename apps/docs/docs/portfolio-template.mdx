## How to Customize Your Portfolio

<div className="relative rounded-[12px] overflow-hidden my-5">
  <img
    className="w-full"
    src="/img/portfolio-modify.gif"
    alt="Customize Portfolio"
  />
</div>

All the portfolio content is fully configurable in the `portfolio.config.ts` file. Let‚Äôs look at how to update different sections of your portfolio.

### Example Configuration

inside `portfolio.config.ts`

```tsx title="portfolio.config.ts"
const portfolioConfig = {
  name: "Lwin Moe Paing",
  hero: heroConfig,
  about: aboutConfig,
  skills: skillsConfig,
  workHistory: workHistoryConfig,
  educationHistory: educationHistoryConfig,
  project: projectConfig,
  contact: contactConfig,
  footer: footerConfig,
} as const;
```

For example, to update the hero section, you can modify the `heroConfig` object:

```tsx title="portfolio.config.ts"
const heroConfig = {
  welcomeMessage: "Hi, I'm Lwin Moe Paing",
  image: "/images/auth/lwin-moe-paing.jpeg",
  message:
    "Senior Frontend Engineer passionate about building and helping others.",
  linkPrefix: "Catch me active on",
  linkSuffix: "üéâ",
  links: [
    { name: "Twitter", link: "https://x.com/LwinMoePaingDev" },
    { name: "Facebook", link: "https://facebook.com/lwin.im" },
  ],
};
```

You can easily update fields like `welcomeMessage`, `image`, `message`, and more. This structure applies to other sections like `skills`, `about`, `workHistory`, and `educationHistory`.

### Getting Started with Customization

1. **Edit the Configuration:** Open `portfolio.config.ts` and update the values according to your personal or professional details.
2. **Preview Your Changes:** Run your project locally to see how the updates look.
3. **Deploy Your Portfolio:** Once you‚Äôre happy with the result, deploy your site using your preferred hosting service.
