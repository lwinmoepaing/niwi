# Project Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Welcome to the NiwiStarter community! As contributors and maintainers of this project, it is important to create a safe and collaborative environment. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all members of the community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected Behavior

We expect all contributors and community members to:

- Be respectful and considerate of others.
- Be inclusive and welcoming to diverse perspectives and experiences.
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism and feedback.
- Show empathy towards other community members.
- Focus on collaboration and teamwork.
- Exercise patience and understanding towards others' learning curves.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

- Harassment, discrimination, or any form of offensive language or behavior.
- Intimidation, trolling, or unwelcome attention.
- Disparaging comments about personal attributes or choices.
- Any form of unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including contributors and maintainers, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including temporary or permanent expulsion from the project and its community.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by contacting [project maintainers' contact information]. All reports will be treated with confidentiality. In your report, please include:

- Your contact information.
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.
- A description of the behavior you find unacceptable and why.
- Screenshots or other evidence, if possible.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Credits

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html].
